# Automobile Data Analysis

## Objective
Analyze factors affecting price, fuel efficiency and vehicle performance using a historical automobile dataset.

## Description
This project involves exploring and modeling a dataset containing specifications of various automobiles. The goal is to identify relationships between attributes like engine size, horsepower, and weight with miles-per-gallon (MPG), and to build predictive models to predict price based on the features.

## Installation
Install required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset
- **Source:** Automobile Dataset  
- **Content:** 200+ entries including features such as make, number of doors, body style, engine location, length, compression ratio, horsepower, peak-rpm, city mpg, highway mpg, horsepower-binned, and designation of diesel or gas.

## Tools & Technologies
You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn
```

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and data type conversions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized distributions and correlations (e.g., weight vs. MPG).
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features and transformed categorical variables.
- **Modeling:** Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression models were trained and evaluated.
- **Evaluation:** Used RÂ² score and RMSE to assess model performance.

## Insights Gained
- As the engine-size goes up, the price goes up: this indicates a positive direct correlation between these two variables. Engine size seems like a pretty good predictor of price since the regression line is almost a perfect diagonal line.

- As highway-mpg goes up, the price goes down: this indicates an inverse/negative relationship between these two variables. Highway mpg could potentially be a predictor of price.
- From our data, it seems rear-wheel drive vehicles are, on average, the most expensive, while 4-wheel and front-wheel are approximately the same in price.
- Since the p-value is $<$ 0.001, the correlation between wheel-base and price is statistically significant, although the linear relationship isn't extremely strong (~0.585).
- Since the p-value is $<$ 0.001, the correlation between horsepower and price is statistically significant, and the linear relationship is quite strong (~0.809, close to 1).
- Since the p-value is $<$ 0.001, the correlation between length and price is statistically significant, and the linear relationship is moderately strong (~0.691).
- Since the p-value is < 0.001, the correlation between width and price is statistically significant, and the linear relationship is quite strong (~0.751).
- Since the p-value is $<$ 0.001, the correlation between engine-size and price is statistically significant, and the linear relationship is very strong (~0.872).
- Since the p-value is $<$ 0.001, the correlation between bore and price is statistically significant, but the linear relationship is only moderate (~0.521).
- Since the p-value is $<$ 0.001, the correlation between city-mpg and price is statistically significant, and the coefficient of about -0.687 shows that the relationship is negative and moderately strong.
- Since the p-value is < 0.001, the correlation between highway-mpg and price is statistically significant, and the coefficient of about -0.705 shows that the relationship is negative and moderately strong.
